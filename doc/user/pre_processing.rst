Pre-processing
###############

The input random catalog (provided through ``--ran-fn``) should contain the following columns:
``ra, dec, flux_g, flux_r, flux_z, sersic, shape_r, shape_e1, shape_e2``.
Examples of how to produce these catalogs are given in `preprocess.py <https://github.com/adematti/obiwan/bin/preprocess.py>`_.
